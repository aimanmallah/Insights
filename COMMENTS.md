The code test was incredibly enjoyable however, due to time constraints and being abroad on holiday, I did not spend as much time as I would have wanted to on the styling on and tests.

If I had more time, I would have added more unit tests to some of the components, tested the custom hook, and made sure the styling was more precise accorording to the wireframes.
